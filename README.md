# Captcha-Form

#1 Generate a random string of characters or numbers to be utilized as a captcha. This can be achieved by producing a random number and converting it to a string through the use of the toString() method, or by creating an array of characters and selecting random characters from it with the Math.random() method.

#2 Display the captcha on the sign-up form by creating an HTML element like a <div> or <span>, and setting the innerHTML property to the randomly generated captcha string.

#3 Include an input field for the user to enter the captcha text. You can use the <input> element and set its type attribute - text.

#4 Upon form submission, verify the user's input against the generated captcha string. You can compare the input text to the generated captcha string with an if statement.

#5 If the entered text matches the generated captcha string, permit the form submission. If not, exhibit an error message and prohibit the form submission.
